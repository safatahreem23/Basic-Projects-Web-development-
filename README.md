# Basic-Projects-Web-development-
I have built a few front-end projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: a personal portfolio to showcase my work, a restaurant menu page with a clean design, a webPage loader with animation,and a simple interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game.These Simple Projects helped me practice responsive design,UI Skills and basic interactivity.
